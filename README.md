Story:
We are bridging the gap between people who want to eat a certain dish…. But don’t know where to start.
Enter…
Cuisine Quest
Core Features:
Drop Down menu that displays cuisine categories (ex. Japanese, Cajun, Italian).
When user clicks category, dishes from that category are displayed on the webpage.
API we will use:
https://apilist.fun/api/food-api
Challenges we expect to face:
We want to add more functionality but we don’t want to stretch ourselves too much in the given time frame. We plan to build more features if time allows.
How are we meeting the requirements for the project?
We are pulling data from an API. We will be iterating through the API with three event listeners planned.
